# DNN-from-scratch-on-MNIST

This program was an assignment for an intro to machine learning course where we were tasked with implementing a Neural Network
from scratch, or in other words perform the matrix multiplication, backprop, activation functions etc by hand instead of using
any machine learning libraries. It should achieve an accuracy of around 98% on MNIST handwritten digits dataset.
